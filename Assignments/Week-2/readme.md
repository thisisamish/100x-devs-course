## Note
I haven't written the code exactly as it was required in the assignment so there was no point in running tests. Sometime later, I might add my own tests with proper documentation of the APIs. For now, I can say that I have properly tested the APIs on my own (in Postman) and you just have to take my word for it. Also, I have left the entire guidelines as it was written in the assignment. I have deleted the tests, solutions and other stuff from the original repo (Harkirat's) that I didn't require. :)
