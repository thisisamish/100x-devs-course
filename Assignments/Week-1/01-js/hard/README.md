## Learnings from this assignment

1. Syntax of OOP in JS.
2. Regex.
3. isNaN(number) is used to check whether a number is NaN. It's important because sometimes we might want to do input validation and have only numbers. But in JS, NaN is also a number so this might lead to bugs. So better to filter that out too.
4. eval(expression) is a used to evaluate a valid JS expression given in string format.
